        <h3>About me</h3>

            <p>I was originally born and grew up in Greece until I left to study Finance & Business at the University of Sussex.
                During my undergrad I did a short internship at the prime brokerage office of Cowen Inc. in London. 
                After that, I went to Sofia, Bulgaria to work for a few months in commercial banking at ProCredit Bank.
                Eventually I quit my job to pursue my MSc in Business Analytics at UCL.
                I finished my master's program in August 2022 and I am currently based in London.</p>
