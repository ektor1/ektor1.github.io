                    <h3>Michael Burry's Big Short</h3> 
                    <p><em>March 20th 2020</em></p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Michael Burry was among the few investors that predicted the 2008 financial crisis which was well illustrated in the film ‘The Big Short’.
                    His interest in the stock market begun during his medical studies. He managed to gain a big following by writing about his investments and opened his
                    own hedge fund, Scion Capital in 2000. By 2008 his fund gained 489.34% of returns after fees while S&P 500 during the same period returned just a bit 
                    over 2%. After closing the fund in 2008, he opened a new hedge fund called Scion Asset Management where he now oversees around $430 million.
                </p>
                <h3>How it started</h3>
                <p>
                    Michael Burry started investigating the US housing market after observing the continuous value increase of properties in San Jose which was the heart 
                    of the dot-com bubble companies in 2001. Starting his research in 2004 he realised that the value of these properties was extremely inflated by the 
                    excessive issuing of mortgages. The demand was driven by investment banks that securitised these mortgages by packaging them together to create bonds
                    called Mortgage Backed Securities (MBSs) in order to sell them to the market. As mortgage brokers started to run out of credit-worthy borrowers they
                    turned to people with little or no means of income; at the top of the bubble they were issuing mortgages without requiring income or 
                    jobs a.k.a. NINJA (No Income, No Job) loans. These risky mortgages, called subprime, along with other types of loans were bought by banks,
                    packaged together to create many different financial instruments such as Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs), get generous fees for doing
                    so and then sell them to investors. CDOs were essentially tranches of MBSs; the typical structure of a CDO included the equity, mezzanine and
                    senior tranche (shown below). The equity trance offering the biggest return included the riskiest loans, the mezzanine tranche had the medium
                    return and the senior tranche was considered the safest and had the lowest return. These CDOs were considered ‘diversified’ as they followed
                    a specific sequence of payments starting from senior and moving to the riskier tranches. So even if the equity tranche defaulted, the investor
                    would still receive payments from the other senior tranches. Investment banks created other complicated financial instruments such as CDO
                    squared and synthetic CDOs. The situation was exacerbated by other external factors such as historic low interest rates, high credit ratings
                    and a faulty regulatory system. This was obviously not going to last forever, and the financial markets were heading towards a heavy crashin full speed.

                <h3>His idea</h3>
                <p>        
                    Michael Burry, realised that when most of these subprime loans defaulted every financial asset that was involved in subprime lending would 
                    become worthless. He predicted that most of them would start defaulting in Q1 2007 and wanting to profit from the coming downturn he dedicated
                    himself to find the riskiest bonds to short. As at that time there was no way to short these instruments, he reached out to banks to create for
                    him Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) which is a form of insurance in case the underlying entity, in this case the mortgagors, defaulted on its 
                    obligations. The banks that cooperated with him included Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, ultimately building a position of
                    at least a billion dollars. Being a prudent investor, he diversified his short positions across these banks and tried to be as careful as
                    possible in choosing them, as the insurance on these instruments would be as good as worthless if the entities that sold them got insolvent
                    in the wake of the crisis. He didn’t choose banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers because these were some of most exposed to MBSs, with 
                    Bear Stearns’s exposure around $400 billion and Lehman reporting a 23.9x leverage ratio. Burry tried to raise more capital to increase the 
                    exposure of his positions by creating a new fund called Milton’s Opus where he would specifically focus on CDS investing. However, he didn’t 
                    receive much interest from his investors and immediately raised concerns about his involvement with these investments as Mike Burry was only 
                    known for stock picking at that time. Unfortunately, he wasn’t the best with people as he has diagnosed himself with Asperger’s Syndrome, an 
                    autism spectrum disorder, and has reported that he always disliked face-to-face interactions choosing to mostly communicate with his investors
                    by e-mail.

                    As the crisis started to unravel, loans where defaulting at an alarming rate and Burry received interest for his CDSs from numerous banks. 
                    Even with his investors’ pressure on his shoulders, he managed to stick with his idea and analysis and didn’t let himself to get influenced
                    by external sources. He finally liquidated his positions in 2007 making $100 million for himself and $725 million for his investors.

                <h3>Further thoughts</h3>
                <p>    
                    Although the exact details of his CDS deals were not specified, below are some thoughts about risk management on his investment.
                    In retrospect, I think Michael Burry’s idea to diversify his positions across different banks was a prudent move. However, taking into account 
                    the exposure of the banks to subprime mortgages prior to the crisis there are also other strategies that he could have followed to hedge his 
                    investments. As mentioned above, the insurance from a counter-party is as good as worthless if it can’t pay back its obligations. In order to 
                    reduce that risk, he could have arranged a contract that in case the underlying entity defaulted, the counter-party that sold him the CDS wouldn’t 
                    have to make a one-off payment, but it would have to start to paying in parts. These payments could be monthly or even daily, making it easier for 
                    the bank to cover the premiums. Another way would be to buy CDSs from another counter-party on the bank you’re buying the CDSs from. So, in case 
                    the bank goes insolvent, he can at least receive payment premiums from the CDSs on that bank. Also, I think we can really see the importance of 
                    teamwork and business relations in that particular case. When Michael Burry wanted to generate higher returns by raising more capital, his 
                    lack of communication with investors and lack of opacity about his positions debilitated his trustworthiness. If he was more self-aware about 
                    his strengths and weaknesses, he could have hired someone else to manage the investors. In that way, he wouldn’t have to fire half of his 
                    workforce and close other positions prematurely limiting his returns.
